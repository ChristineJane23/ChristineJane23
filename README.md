Hi everyone!

I was first introduced to programming in my first year of college. At first, I was a bit intimidated by it but I never thought that I would love doing programming ever since.

Programming takes a lot of patience and hard work, especially for me, since I'm still a practitioner and not a master of it. I also jump from language to language so much that I never took a time to master one language. I think that's one of my bad habits but I'm a naturally curious person and I just wanted to learn new things so much. It takes me days or weeks to solve a problem in coding sometimes but it gives me so much joy every time I solved it or finished it myself. I'm also the kind of person who doesn't give up until I found the solution to that problem.

Currently, I'm fighting my boredom, programming small tools that can be useful in our workplace. I'm also kind of doing game development in my spare time. 

Also, I'm the assigned Team Leader in our team -- Team Legacy, and I'm currently developing Shopify and Wordpress sites for clients. I'm starting to learn that it's kinda hard to juggle all of your work and hobbies at the same time.
